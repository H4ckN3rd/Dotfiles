After installing Debian, update your system:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

**3. Install Required Packages**

Install the following packages:

```

**Oh-My-ZSH**

Add the last line to your i3 configuration file (`~/.config/i3/config`) to ensure the agent starts automatically.
